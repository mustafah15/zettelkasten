- Kafka can be used for collecting big data and real-time analysis. Here are some of its top use cases:

- **Metrics**: Kafka can be used to collect and aggregate monitoring data. Distributed services can push different operational metrics to Kafka servers. These metrics can then be pulled from Kafka to produce aggregated statistics.
- **Log Aggregation**: Kafka can be used to collect logs from multiple sources and make them available in a standard format to multiple consumers.
- **Stream processing**: Kafka is quite useful for use cases where the collected data undergoes processing at multiple stages. For example, the raw data consumed from a topic is transformed, enriched, or aggregated and pushed to a new topic for further consumption. This way of data processing is known as stream processing.
- **Commit Log**: Kafka can be used as an external commit log for any distributed system. Distributed services can log their transactions to Kafka to keep track of what is happening. This transaction data can be used for replication between nodes and also becomes very useful for disaster recovery, for example, to help failed nodes to recover their states.
- **Website activity tracking**: One of Kafka’s original use cases was to build a user activity tracking pipeline. User activities like page clicks, searches, etc., are published to Kafka into separate topics. These topics are available for subscription for a range of use cases, including real-time processing, real-time monitoring, or loading into [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) or data warehousing systems for offline processing and reporting.
- **Product suggestions**: Imagine an online shopping site like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), which offers a feature of ‘similar products’ to suggest lookalike products that a customer could be interested in buying. To make this work, we can track every consumer action, like search queries, product clicks, time spent on any product, etc., and record these activities in Kafka. Then, a consumer application can read these messages to find correlated products that can be shown to the customer in real-time. Alternatively, since all data is persistent in Kafka, a batch job can run overnight on the ‘similar product’ information gathered by the system, generating an email for the customer with product suggestions.
