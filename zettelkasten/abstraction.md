- What Is Abstraction?
	- Abstraction can be thought of as the natural extension of encapsulation. It means hiding all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce the complexity of the system. In a large system, objects talk to each other, which makes it difficult to maintain a large code base; abstraction helps by hiding internal implementation details of objects and only revealing operations that are relevant to other objects.
