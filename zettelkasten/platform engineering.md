## What is Platform Engineering 

platform engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations. 

## Why do Companies need platform engineering teams?

- Before DevOps
	- Dev teams send deployable packages to ops teams waiting until deployment to happen depending on ops teams' schedule. 
	- If deployment has issues because of the code the Ops teams would wait for dev teams to fix it.
	- slow communication between ops and dev teams lead to slow delivery 
- DevOps Introduction 
	- combine dev and ops in one team, less communication challenges.
	- "You build it you run it"
- problems with DevOps
	- High Cognitive Load on Engineers as they own the whole stack
	- Different Solutions for the same problem in the same company 
- Internal Developer Platform Introduction 
	- Formal Definition: A set of tools and tech that a platform engineering team binds together into a golden path to enable developer self-service. 
	- **Internal**: clearly separated from externally facing platforms, IDPs are meant for internal use only.
	- **Developer** – indicates the internal customer and the primary user, the application developer.
	- **Platform** – characterizes the product type
- Why Internal Platform?
	- Providing Developers with self-service option and at the same time driving standardization IDPs boost developer productivity and developer experience through a reduction in waiting time or manual work for operations. 
	- Every company/team has their own needs for IDP

	- INTEGRATION DELIVERY PLANE
	- RESOURCE PLANE
	- SECURITY PLANE
	- OBSERVABILITY PLANE
	- 
	- building a platform layer on top of the infrastructure that product teams can use without going deep into infra ca
	- having a shared solution for common problems. 
	- Building a base for Product teams to use so they can kick-start their work directly without starting from scratch.
