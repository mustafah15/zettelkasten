to ensure a project's success you must develop a ubiquitous language that can be used for communication by all stakeholders, the language should reflect the domain experts' mental models of the business domain's inner workings and underlying principles. since our goal is to use ubiquitous language to drive software design decisions the language must be clear and consistent. it should be free of ambiguity, implicit assumptions, and extraneous details. however, on an organisational scale, the domain experts' mental models can be inconsistent themselves. different domain experts can use different models of the same business domain.

## Bounded Contexts in Real Life

bounded contexts are not as evident as business domains and subdomains but they are there as domain experts' mental models are, you just have to be conscious of how domain experts think about the different business entities and processes.

### Semantic Domains

It can be said that domain-driven design's bounded contexts are based on the lexicographical notion of [semantic domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_domain#:~:text=In%20lexicography%20a%20semantic%20domain,%2C%20raindrop%2C%20puddle.%22.) A semantic domain is defined as an area of meaning and the words used to talk about it, for example, the word monitor, port, and processor have different meaning in the software and hardware engineering semantic domains.
