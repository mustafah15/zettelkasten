### Model Boundaries

as we know that a model is not a copy of the real world but a construct that helps us make sense of a complex system. The problem it is supposed to solve is an inherent part of a model its purpose. A model cannot exist without a boundary; it will expand to become a copy of the real world. that makes defining a model boundary - its bounded contexts - an intrinsic part of the modeling process. 
just as a subway map is useless for nautical navigation, a ubiquitous language in one bounded context can be completely irrelevant to the scope of another bounded context.
Bounded contexts define the applicability of a [[lddd - ubiquitous language]] and of the model it represents, in other words, bounded contexts are the consistency boundaries of a ubiquitous language. A language's terminology principles and business rules are only consistent inside its bounded context.
