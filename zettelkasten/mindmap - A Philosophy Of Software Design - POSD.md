# A Philosophy Of Software Design

## complexity in software design
- Fighting Against Complexity
    - by eliminating complexity
    - by encapsulating complexity
- The Incremental Nature of Complexity
- Causes Of Complexity
    - dependencies
    - obscurity
- Symptoms of Complexity
    - change amplification
    - cognitive load
    - unknown unknowns

## working code is not enough
- Tactical Programming
    - tactical tornado
- Strategic Programming
    - strategic programming investment
        - Investment types
            - reactive
            - proactive
        - How Much to Invest

## [[POSD - modules should be deep]]
- [[module abstraction]]
- [[modular design]]
    - [[module interface]]
    - [[module implementation]]
- [[deep modules]]
- [[shallow modules]]
- [[classitis]]

## [[POSD - information hiding and information leakage]]
- [[POSD - information hiding]]
- [[POSD - information leakage]]
    - [[how to prevent information leakage]]
    - [[POSD - information leakage types]]
- [[POSD - temporal decomposition]]

## [[POSD - general purpose modules vs special purpose modules]]
- [[general purpose module]]
    - benefits of general-purpose modules
- [[special purpose module]]

## [[POSD - different layer different abstraction]]
- [[pass-through methods]]
    - why pass-through methods are bad?
- [[pass-through variables]]
    - why do pass-through variables add complexity?
- [[POSD - When is interface duplication okay?]]
