a good rule of thumb to help you get an SLO target is the happiness test

The test states that service needs target SLOs that capture the performance and availability levels that if barely met would keep a typical user happy.
if your service meets the target SLO that you have happy customers if it misses the target that means you have sad customers ![[Screenshot 2023-12-17 at 18.59.46.png]]
