## What is a model?
A model is not a copy of the real world but a human contract that helps us make sense of real-world systems.

A canonical example of a model is a map. Any map is a model including navigation maps, terrain maps world maps....
none of these maps represents all the details of our plants. instead, each map contains just enough data to support its particular purpose: the problem it is supposed to solve.
