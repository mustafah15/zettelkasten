As the name implies, these patterns provide optimized object-creation techniques. They help cater to the design and complexity problems that might occur when using the basic approach. They also help control the creation of objects.

In plain words, Creational patterns are focused on how to instantiate an object or group of related objects.

Wikipedia says: In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
