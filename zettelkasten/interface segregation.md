statement: __Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use__


The goal behind implementing the ISP is to have a precise code design that follows the correct abstraction guidelines and tends to be more flexible, which would help in making it more robust and reusable. This becomes key when more and more features are added to the software, making it bloated and harder to maintain.

The ISP, being an important principle, is the most violated principle in object-oriented programming. This can easily be achieved by adding more features to our software, requiring us to update large parts of our program. A few benefits of the ISP are as follows:

- It helps to keep our software maintainable and robust.
- It allows for efficient refactoring and redeployment of code.
