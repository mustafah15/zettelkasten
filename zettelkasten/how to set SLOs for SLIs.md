an [[SLOs]] is just a target that you get to pick so once you have decided on that target you measure the performance of SLIs against it over a period of time.

depending on what our target SLO is our SLI will instantly tell us whether or not a certain point in time was good or bad![[Screenshot 2023-12-17 at 19.20.11.png]]
