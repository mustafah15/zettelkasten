mistaking learning with cramming is still very much ingrained in our education culture

instead if we foucse our time and energy on understanding and learning one topic you can't help your self but to learn. 

also important if you focus your time and energy on learning without trying to understand you will not only understand but also not learn

there is a reason why the best scientists are also often very good teachers [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)  was one examples on those great scientists and great teacher and always passionate about learning and simplifying knowledge to others.
