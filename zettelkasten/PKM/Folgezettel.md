what is Folgezettel or sequence notes?
It's important to know that Folgezettel it's not what [[Niklas Luhmann]] used to but he was engaged in the practice of creating a Folgezettel which is creating a sequence of notes each of which has some relation to the note before it or good enough relation.

However, with ease of use note taking apps, it's easy to link the ideas without specifying such relation. but creating a sequence of notes you develop lines of thinking in a way that helps you to focus your thinking or your writing in one direction, also it makes you avoid collecting a lot of information ideas and notes in a direction that you might not need at the moment.

### how do I see myself using folgezettel in my system?

- I see that folgezettel can replace my usage of mindmap to build an overview for a specific topic or topics (ideas with some sort of relations in between)
- however, I don't think that I can have every note in my PKB sorted in folgezettel way

Do you think this contradicts with [[Rapid Logging]]?
not really this technique helps you to have a reason for your ideas or for your learning or even sort your existing notes in a way that is more concrete to be published or at least more mature and sorted.
