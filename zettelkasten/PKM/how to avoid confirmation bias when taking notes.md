- ### how do you avoid confirmation bias in your writing?
	- Confirmation bias in [[zettelkasten]] can be tackled by turning the writing process on its head and changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to gathering any relevant information indiscriminately regardless of what argument it will support. 
	- developing arguments and ideas bottom up instead of tip down is the most important step to opening ourselves up for insight we postpone the decision on what to write about specifically and focus on building a critical mass within the [[zettelkasten]] as we want to:
		- confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read
		- make sure we have given a true account of its content
		- find the relevance of it and make a connection
