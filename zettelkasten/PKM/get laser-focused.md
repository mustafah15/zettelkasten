attention is not our only limited resource our short-term memory is also limited as we need strategies to save its capacity to better delegate to an external system.
Estimations of our long-term memory are speculative however psychologists tend to agree on a specific number for short-term memory we can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time plus or minus two
information in our short-term memory floats around our heads, seeking attention, and occupies valuable mental resources until it's forgotten and replaced by something more important according to our brain or instead moved to the long-term memory.
Also, it's much easier to remember things we understand than things we don't, things we understand are connected either through rules, theories, logic, or explanations every step in writing should be accompanied by questions that deepen your understanding of the idea and connect it to your existing ideas.
