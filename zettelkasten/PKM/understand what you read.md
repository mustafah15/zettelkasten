to get a good piece written you only have to rewrite a draft and to get a good draft written you have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text and as a series of notes is just the argument of notes you already have in your [[zettelkasten]] all you have to do is to have a pen and paper in your hand when you read to collect ideas and write them in your own context.

a good way of understanding what you read is to translate it into your own understanding into your own context and then save it in your [[zettelkasten]] this will transform what you consume into something totally new and your own and as a result, your [[zettelkasten]] becomes richer your own thinking as well become richer
