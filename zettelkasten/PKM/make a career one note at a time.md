As Academic and non-fiction writing is not predictable because in addition to the writing, there is the reading, the research the thinking and the linking with ideas, it also does not make sense to break down writing into manageable steps and pages per day don't work that well as a unit, the [[zettelkasten]] can be considered as compound interest as the same as writing a page every day its content is worth much more than the sum of the notes more notes mean more possible connections more new ideas more synergy between different projects and therefore a much higher degree of productivity ( [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[zettelkasten]] contained 90,000 notes)
