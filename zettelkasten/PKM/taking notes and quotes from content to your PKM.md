It's important to understand that copying quotes always changes their meaning by stripping them of context even if the words aren't changed this a common beginner mistake that can only lead to a patchwork of ideas but never coherent thoughts.

while [[literature notes]] should be stored with a reference system separate from your original [[zettelkasten]]  they should be written with an eye towards the lines of thoughts within the [[zettelkasten]] check HTSN p73 to see how [[Niklas Luhmann]] wrote reference notes

how extensive the literature notes should depends on the text and what we need them for it also depends on our ability to be concise about the complexity of the text and how difficult it is to understand as [[literature notes]] are also a tool for understanding, which should be fine writing more of them especially if we are studying a difficult subject

Also, it's important to consider writing them by hand as that can make a difference in terms of understanding the content of what you read or study this is also supported by some studies (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014) the explanation is simple handwriting is slower and can't be corrected quickly this slowness forces you to think about what you are consuming.

Making [[literature notes]] this way is very different from the traditional way of highlighting as it provides support for the next step which is writing the actual [[zettelkasten]] [[permanent notes]], and with these permanent notes everything is about building up a critical mass of useful notes which gives us a clear idea how to read and how to take a literature notes.

while selectivity is the key to smart note-taking it's important to be selective in a smart way while we should seek out disconfirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good with everything that confirms what we already believe we know (confirmation bias)
