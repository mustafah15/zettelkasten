## what is a scorned brain?

Since information is the building block for everything that we do now, your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively

### notes as knowledge-building blocks 

In the past centuries, only the intellectual elite needed commonplace books - writers, politicians, and scientists who needed a reason to synthesize their writing or research
nowadays almost everyone needs a way to manage information more than half the workforce can be considered "knowledge workers" professionals for whom knowledge is their most valuable asset, and who spend the majority of their time managing large amounts of information


as a knowledge worker, where does your knowledge live? where does your knowledge go when it's created or discovered? "knowledge" can seem like a lofty concept reserved exclusively for scholars and academics, but at the most practical level, knowledge begins with the simple time-honored practice of note-taking

when you enter the professional world the demand on your note-taking completely changes from what you may have been used to when you were in school or in university in the professional world: 
- it needs to be clarified what you should be taking notes on. 
- no one tells yoyu when or how your notes will be used -> exams in schools 
- the "test" can come at any time and in any form
- you are allowed to reference your notes at any time, provided you took them in the first place. 
- you are expected to take action on your notes.
and this is different from the note-taking that you learned in school.
