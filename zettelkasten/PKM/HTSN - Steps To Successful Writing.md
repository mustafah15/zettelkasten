### The Steps To Successful Writing 

- [[avoid multi-tasking]]

- Get Closure 
	- attention is not our only limited resource our short-term memory is also limited as we need strategies not to waste its capacity we can better delegate to an external system.
	- estimations of our long-term memory are speculative however psychologists tend to agree on a specific number for short-term memory we can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time plus or minus two
	- information in our short term memory is kind of float around our heads seek attention and occupies valuable mental resources until it's forgotten and replaced by something more important according to our brain or instead moved to the long term memory.
	- Also it's much easier to remember things we understand than things we don't, things we understand are connected either through rules, theories, logic, or explanations every step in writing should be accompanied by questions that deepen your understanding of the idea and connect it to your existing ideas.
- reduce the number of decisions
	- One more LIMITED RESOURCE IS OUR motivation and willpower if we don't have a system and workflow that is designed to limit the decisions that we need to make every day to keep working that would be ideal. by always using the same notebook for making notes always extracting ideas in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of notes which are dealt with in the same manner the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced. which leaves us with much more mental energy that can be directed towards more useful tasks like trying to solve problems in questions (questions we create to have harden our understanding of a specific topic that we are working on)
- become an expert by practicing 
	- writing is like an art which  it is something we can become better at with experience and deliberate practice experts in any field rely on experience which enables them to learn the state of virtuosity to become an expert we need the freedom to make our own decisions and all necessary mistakes that help us learn, like bicycling it can be only learned by doing. the workflow around [[zettelkasten]] is not a prescription that tells you what to do at which stage of writing it's quite the opposite as it gives you a structure of clearly separable tasks which can be completed within a reasonable time and in the same time provide you with instant feedback through inter-connected writing 
- read for understanding
	- to get a good piece written you only have to rewrite a draft and to get a good draft written you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text and as a series of notes is just the argument of notes you already have in your [[zettelkasten]] all you really have to do is to have a pen and paper in your hand when you read to collect ideas and write them in your own context.
	- if you understand what you read and translate it into a different context of your own thinking materialized in the slip-box you can't help but transform the finding and thoughts that you read into something that is new and your own and as a result the richer your [[zettelkasten]] become the richer your own thinking becomes.
	- we have to translate the ideas we read or consume into our own language to prepare them to be embedded into the new context of our own thinking
	- #### putting highlights and quotes in your PKM
		- copying quotes always changes their meaning by stripping them of context even if the words aren't changed this is a common beginner mistake that can only lead to a patchwork of ideas but never coherent thoughts.
		- while the literature notes will be stored with a reference system separate from the slip-box but still close to the context of the original text they should be written with an eye towards the lines of thoughts within the slip-box check p73 to see how [[Niklas Luhmann]] write references notes
		- how extensive the literature notes should depend on the text and what we need them for it also depends on our ability to be concise about the complexity of the text and how difficult it is to understand
		- literature notes are also a tool for understanding, which should be fine writing more of them especially if we are studying a difficult subject
		- taking literature notes this way is very different from the traditional way of highlighting as it provides support for the next step which is writing the actual [[zettelkasten]] notes, and with these permanent notes everything is about building up a critical mass of useful notes which gives us a clear idea how to read and how to take a literature notes.
		- when taking ref notes writing them by hand can make a difference in terms of understainding the content of what you read or study this is also supported by some studies (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014) the explanation is simple handwriting is slower and can't be corrected quickly this slowness forces you to think about what you are consuming.
		- while selectivity is the key to smart note-taking it's important to be selective in a smart way while we should seek out disconfirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good with everything that confirms what we already believe we know (confirmation bias)
		- how do you avoid confirmation bias in your writing?
			- Confirmation bias in Zettelkasten can be tackled by turning the writing process on its head and changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to gathering any relevant information indiscriminately regardless of what argument it will support. 
			- developing arguments and ideas bottom up instead of tip down is the most important step to opening ourselves up for insight we postpone the decision on what to write about specifically and focus on building a critical mass within the [[zettelkasten]] as we want to:
				- confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read
				- make sure we have given a true account of its content
				- find the relevance of it and make a connection
				  
- take smart notes
- develop ideas
- Share your insight 
- make it a habit
