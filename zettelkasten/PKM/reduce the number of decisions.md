One more LIMITED RESOURCE IS OUR motivation and willpower if we don't have a system and workflow that is designed to limit the decisions that we need to make every day to keep working that would be ideal. by always using the same notebook for making notes always extracting ideas in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of notes which are dealt with in the same manner the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced. which leaves us with much more mental energy that can be directed towards more useful tasks like trying to solve problems in questions (questions we create to harden our understanding of a specific topic that we are working on)
