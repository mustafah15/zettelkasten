In this file, I will document my journey of running a personal homelab 

My ultimate goal of running a personal homelab/homeserver

1. running a pihole to prevent adds and malicious websites.
2. running a kubernetes cluster for learning doing that also setting up a monitors for that (grafana, prometheus) and learning about GitOps in general.
3. running my personal blog on top of that (2) 
4. running my own docker registry 
5. hosting my side projects on this server 
6. hosting and packing up my data (photos, files) on this server
