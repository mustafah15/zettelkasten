### **core subdomain** 
A core subdomain is what a company does differently from its competitors (the interesting problems)

#### complexity 
A core subdomain that is simple to implement can provide a short-lived competitive advantage. therefore core subdomains are naturally complex.

#### source of competitive advantage
It's important to note that core subdomains are not necessarily technical. not all business problems are solved through algorithms or other technical solutions a company's competitive advantage can come from various sources. 
Imagine a company that specializes in manual fraud detection the company trains its analysts to go over documents and flag potential fraud cases, if you are building the software system that analysts are working with, is that a core subdomain? No. the core subdomain is the work the analysts are doing. the system you are building has nothing to do with the fraud analysis.
