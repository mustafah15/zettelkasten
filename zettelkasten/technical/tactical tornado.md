the tactical tornado is a prolific programmer who pumps out code far faster than others but works in a totally tactical fashion, when it comes to implementing a quick feature nobody gets it done faster than the tactical tornado. in some organizations, management treats tactical tornados as heroes. However, they leave behind a wake of destruction. they are rarely considered heroes by the engineers who must work on their code in the future. typically other engineers must clean up the messes left behind by the [[tactical tornado]] which makes it appear that those engineers who are the real heroes are making slower progress than the tactical tornado.
