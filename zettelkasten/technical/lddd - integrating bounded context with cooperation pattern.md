## Cooperation

Cooperation patterns related to bounded contexts are implemented by teams with well-established communication. 
In the simplest case, these are bounded contexts implemented by a single team. this also applies to teams with dependent goals, where one team's success depends on the success of the other and vice versa. again the main criterion here is the quality of the team communication and collaboration.
There are two DDD patterns suitable for cooperating teams: the partnership and shared kernel patterns.
