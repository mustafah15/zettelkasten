A general purpose module you implement a module that can be used to address a broad range of problems, not just the ones that are important today

### Benefits of general-purpose modules
- The results in simpler and deeper interfaces than the [[special purpose module]]
- The general purpose approach can save you time in the future if you reuse the classes for other purposes,
- However, even if the module is only used for its original purpose the general purpose is still better because of its simplicity.
