to ensure a project's success you must develop a [[lddd - ubiquitous language]] that can be used for communication by all stakeholders, the language should reflect the domain experts' mental models of the business domain's inner workings and underlying principles. since our goal is to use ubiquitous language to drive software design decisions the language must be clear and consistent. it should be free of ambiguity, implicit assumptions, and extraneous details. however, on an organizational scale, the domain experts' mental models can be inconsistent themselves. different domain experts can use different models of the same business domain.
