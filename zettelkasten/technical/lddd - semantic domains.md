It can be said that domain-driven design's bounded contexts are based on the lexicographical notion of [semantic domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_domain#:~:text=In%20lexicography%20a%20semantic%20domain,%2C%20raindrop%2C%20puddle.%22.) A semantic domain is defined as an area of meaning and the words used to talk about it, for example, the word monitor, port, and processor have different meaning in the software and hardware engineering semantic domains.
