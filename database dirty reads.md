- what is a dirty read?
	- is the state of reading uncommitted data. In this circumstance, we are not sure about the consistency of the data that is read because we donâ€™t know the result of the open transaction(s). After reading the uncommitted data, the open transaction can be completed with a rollback or the open transaction can complete its actions successfully.
