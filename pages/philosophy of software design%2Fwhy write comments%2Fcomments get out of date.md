- comments do sometimes get out of date. but this need not be a major problem in practice keeping documentation up-to-date does not require an enormous effort. large changes to documentation are only required if there have been large changes to the code and the code changes will take more time than the documentation changes, and code review should provide a great mechanism for detecting and fixing stale comments.
