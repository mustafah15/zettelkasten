	 - The Manifesto was created in response to companies trying to cope with changes in the software landscape, what happens was multiple groups of people independently developing similar patterns for solving similar problems. Aspects of a Reactive System were individually recognized by these groups, and [[The Reactive Manifesto]] trying to bring these common ideas into a single unified set of principles.
