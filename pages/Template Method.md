	 - The template Method is used prominently in frameworks. Each framework implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture and defines "placeholders" for all necessary or interesting client customization options. In so doing, the framework becomes the "centre of the universe", and the client customizations are simply "the third rock from the sun". This inverted control structure has been affectionately labelled "the Hollywood principle" - "don't call us, we'll call you".

		 - The template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes.

		 - In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioural design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
