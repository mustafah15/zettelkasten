title: cognitive load
---

- cognitive load means how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task. A higher cognitive load means that developers have to spend more time learning the required information and there is a greater risk of bugs because they have missed something important. cognitive load arises in many forms such as APIs with many methods, global variables inconsistencies and dependencies between modules.

- system designers sometimes assume a wrong assumption that complexity can be measured by lines of code. they assume that if one implementation is shorter than another, then it must be simpler; if it only takes a few lines of code to make a change, then the change must be easy however this view ignores the costs associated with cognitive load I have seen frameworks that allowed applications to be written with only a few lines of code but it was extremely difficult to figure out what those lines where. 

- **sometimes an approach that requires more lines of code actually simpler because it reduces cognitive load**
